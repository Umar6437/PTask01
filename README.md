# Python Language 

# Introduction

The Python Language is a high level language created by Mr. Guido Van in 1991. It is a simple syntax language close to english language. It is consider beginer friendly language.

1. It is General purpose and Dynamic language.

2. It contain a variety of libraries for various fields like AI, machine learning, gaming development, etc. 
3. It has two version which was used mostly. One is Python 2 and other is Python 3 and python 2 to 3 which was to convert each other. But now Python 3 is most commonly used due to its advance security feactures

# Python 3 Basics

Python 3 is version of Python Programing language which was later released in 2008. It include several features as shown below:

1. Unicode-based Stirng type
2. Built-in print function
3. Automatic floating point promotion

# The New Generation Language
Some basic Rules for Python Include:

1. As in other programming language commnands syntax cannot be used as variable name
2. Variable name cannot use space
3. The first character of variable name should be underscore or letter
4. Python is case sensitive
5. Python uses indentation for block structure not braces
6. Python "for" loop does not use paranthesis

# Difference Between Python 2 and Python 3

There are many changes done when Python 3 was introduced. Main changes was the syntax which somehow different in both.

1. Divison Operator: 
The Division Operator run differently in both. In python 2 we have to put atleast one decimal numbr to get the exact answer we don't we get the wronge answer. This problem was resolved in Python 3 where if we divide to integer we don't need to put any decimal number

2. Print Function:
The Print function in Python 2 was much simpler than Python 3 we can simple type print and the value inverted commas in Python 2 and also if we want we can write in brackets while in python 3 it was made compulsory to use brackets along with inverted commas.

3. Coding Scheme:
The Python 2 uses ASCII coding scheme while Python 3 uses advance than ASCII which is unicode which uses different special character which is not available in ASCII.

4. range() and xrange
range() returns the list while xrange recontructs the sequence every time to save memory. These both are used in python 2 while in python 3 only range() is used it also work as a xrange which is big advantage.

# Keywords in Python

keywords are the set words which are reserved by the python language for its use. There are two sets of keywords:

1. Set 1: true, false, note, and, or, not, , in, is, For, While, Break, Continue, if, else, Elif 

2. Set2: Return, Yield, With, Pass, Lambda, Import, From, try, expet, finally, raise, assert, Del, Global, Non-local


# Namespace and Scope in Python

The Namespace is naming system to avoid any conflict between objects or variables. It is used to map between Names or Objects. There there types of Namespace:

1. Local namespace: It is namespace which is defined within the function or method. It can be acessable within the function or that method only. Outsiders cannot access that namespace.

2. Global namespace: It is namespace which is available for every function or objects in the program. 

3. Built-in namespace: It is namespace which are available inside the program we don not have to give them any name like print(), true, false, none, etc.

The scope of the variable is the block or code which use that variable and modified it and store it. There are two types of Variable scope:

1. Local Variable Scope: It is available only within the function which cannot be accessed by the outsider of function.

2. Global Variable Scope: It is available for all code. It can be used anywhere in the program.

# Statement, Indentation and Comment in Python

Statement: It is set of instruction that is provided to interpretor to perform a task. There are different statements like conditional statement, assignment statement, looping statement etc.

Indentation: It is the set of statement which is close to program. In other words the block of codes for the program is called indentation.

Comment: It is just to define the code to other programmers while updating. Complier ignore there lines as this is not related to working it is just for the easiness for other programmer to learn it easily. It starts with #.
